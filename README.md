# ticket_to_ride
Project to build an AI to play Ticket to Ride

NEXT STEPS:
1. Create a game class that initializes entire game state (list of players, number of points, number of trains remaining, length of longest train for each player, ownership of each route, cards in train card burn deck, destination cards for each user, etc)
2. Write moves for each player (1. draw 2 train cards (either swap or two new ones), claim a route, pick 3 destination cards)
3. Write player that does random moves
4. Research AI for imperfect games
